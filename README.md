# wordleTakeHomeChallenge
## the purpose of this repository
For this take-home challenge I was asked to identify a user story for the popular game 'wordle' and attempt to recreate the functionality of the game enough to meet the requirements of that user story

## User story
Players are seeking the sensation of immediate reward. While guessing the correct word is the ultimate goal, continuous play is fun due to the nature of incrementally progessing through ones' guesses. But this is only true if each accurate guess is rewarded.
Users want to know with each submitted guess:
  - which letters exist in the correct word;
  - which letters were guessed in the correct position within the word.
  
## Outcome
To achieve this I have replicated a single line of 5 squares, as we would see in wordle, and replicated the game mechanics in order to allow the user to:
- enter a guess by typing directly into the squares on screen
- submit their guess by pressing 'Enter'
- receive feedback on the accuracy of their guess
- submit a new guess once the page clears

This page will always consider the same word, since that was the minimum viable product for the requirements of this project. That could of course be adjusted in later iterations if the project were to grow in scope.

You can test the game by following this [link](https://camelphonso.github.io/wordleTakeHomeChallenge/)
